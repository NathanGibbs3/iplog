Known Problems
--------------

    - I'm still unable to reproduce iplog going nuts and eating 100% of the
      CPU time.  I can't see anything that'd cause this to happen, either.
      If this is happening to you, it'd be very helpful if you could send
      me tcpdump output (tcpdump -w) of the traffic that triggers it.  My
      only guess as to why it happens is bad interaction between the threads
      and libpcap.  I'm using version 0.5.2 of libpcap on Linux 2.4 without
      problems, for what it's worth.  If you do have this problem, could
      you try upgrading libpcap to version 0.5.2 and see if it goes away.

    - To people who can't get iplog to log anything:
      Can you try commenting out line 41 of iplog.c and seeing if that makes iplog
      produce logs.  If it does, what percentage of CPU time does ps or top show
      iplog consuming.  If deleting that line helps you at all, I'd be interested
      in hearing about it.  Could you send me email with your operating system
      and OS version and details about what happened when you removed that line.

    - iplog triggers bugs in OpenBSD 2.5's (and likely anything prior to 2.5)
      libc_r, and usually dies because of these bugs shortly after starting up.
        * The problems (above) I experienced with OpenBSD 2.5 seem to be fixed
          in OpenBSD 2.6 (I tried the Oct. 14, 1999 snapshot and the 2.6
          release).

Other Stuff
-----------

    - I want to port iplog to more platforms.  If you'd like to do this
      or provide access so I can do this, I'd be awfully grateful.

Nathan's TODO
	1. Clean up logging code.
